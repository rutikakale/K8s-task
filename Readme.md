# Practical Assignment #

## Task: ##

You are given an application image that runs a web server.
Perform the following steps:

### 1.Create a Deployment that runs the application with at least 2 pods.

### 2.Ensure all pods are created successfully and are in Running state.

### 3.Create a NodePort Service to expose the application.

### 4.Access the application from a browser using:
http://<NodeIP><NodePort>

- Open browser and navigate to: http://<NodeIP>:30007

### 5.Verify that the application output is  visible in the browser.

### 6.Take a screenshot of the browser output.

# README.md File Requirements #
### 7.Create a README.md file and add:

* Deployment name: web-app

* Service type used: NodePort

* URL used to access the application

  http://<NodeIP>:30007

* Screenshot of the browser output
